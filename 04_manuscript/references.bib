	abstract = {The understanding of host-microbial partnerships has become a hot topic during the last decade; as it has been shown that associated microbiota play critical roles in the host physiological functions and susceptibility to diseases. Moreover, the microbiome may contribute to host resilience to environmental stressors. The sea anemone Aiptasia is a good laboratory model system to study corals and their microbial symbiosis. In this regard, studying its bacterial microbiota provides a better understanding of cnidarian metaorganisms as a whole. Here, we investigated the bacterial communities of different Aiptasia host-symbiont combinations under long-term heat stress under laboratory conditions. Following a 16S {rRNA} gene sequencing approach we were able to detect significant differences in the bacterial composition and structure of Aiptasia reared at different temperatures. A higher number of taxa (i.e., species richness) and consequently increased α-diversity and β-dispersion were observed in the microbiomes of heat-stressed individuals across all host strains and experimental batches. Our findings are in line with the recently proposed Anna Karenina principle ({AKP}) for animal microbiomes, which states that dysbiotic or stressed organisms have a more variable and unstable microbiota than healthy ones. Microbial interactions affect the fitness and survival of their hosts, thus exploring the {AKP} effect on animal microbiomes is important to understand host resilience. Our data contributes to the current knowledge of the Aiptasia holobiont and to the growing field of study of host-associated microbiomes.},

The consistency of relationships between corals and speciﬁc prokaryotes, however, is debated, and the locations where microbially mediated processes occur in the host are not resolved. Here, we examined how the prokaryotic associates of ﬁve common Caribbean corals with different evolutionary and ecological traits differ across mucus and tissue habitats. We used physical and chemical separation of coral mucus and tissue and sequencing of partial small-subunit {rRNA} genes of bacteria and archaea from these samples to demonstrate that coral tissue and mucus harbor unique reservoirs of prokaryotes, with 23 to 49\% and 31 to 56\% of sequences exclusive to the tissue and mucus habitats, respectively. Across all coral species, we found that 46 tissue- and 22 mucus-speciﬁc microbial members consistently associated with the different habitats. Sequences classifying as “Candidatus Amoebophilus,” Bacteroidetes-afﬁliated intracellular symbionts of amoebae, emerged as previously unrecognized tissue associates of three coral species. This study demonstrates how coral habitat differentiation enables highly resolved examination of ecological interactions between corals and their associated microorganisms and identiﬁes previously unrecognized tissue and mucus associates of Caribbean corals for future targeted study.},

	abstract = {Most multicellular organisms harbor microbial colonizers that provide various benefits to their hosts. Although these microbial communities may be host species- or even genotype-specific, the associated bacterial communities can respond plastically to environmental changes. In this study, we estimated the relative contribution of environment and host genotype to bacterial community composition in Nematostella vectensis, an estuarine cnidarian. We sampled N. vectensis polyps from 5 different populations along a north–south gradient on the Atlantic coast of the United States and Canada. In addition, we sampled 3 populations at 3 different times of the year. While half of the polyps were immediately analyzed for their bacterial composition by 16S {rRNA} gene sequencing, the remaining polyps were cultured under laboratory conditions for 1 month. Bacterial community comparison analyses revealed that laboratory maintenance reduced bacterial diversity by 4-fold, but maintained a population-specific bacterial colonization. Interestingly, the differences between bacterial communities correlated strongly with seasonal variations, especially with ambient water temperature. To decipher the contribution of both ambient temperature and host genotype to bacterial colonization, we generated 12 clonal lines from 6 different populations in order to maintain each genotype at 3 different temperatures for 3 months. The bacterial community composition of the same N. vectensis clone differed greatly between the 3 different temperatures, highlighting the contribution of ambient temperature to bacterial community composition. To a lesser extent, bacterial community composition varied between different genotypes under identical conditions, indicating the influence of host genotype. In addition, we identified a significant genotype x environment interaction determining microbiota plasticity in N. vectensis. From our results we can conclude that N. vectensis-associated bacterial communities respond plastically to changes in ambient temperature, with the association of different bacterial taxa depending in part on the host genotype. Future research will reveal how this genotype-specific microbiota plasticity affects the ability to cope with changing environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {Microbes are well-recognized members of the coral holobiont. However, little is known about the short-term dynamics of mucus-associated microbial communities under natural conditions and after disturbances, and how these dynamics relate to the host's health. Here we examined the natural variability of prokaryotic communities (based on 16S ribosomal {RNA} gene amplicon sequencing) associating with the surface mucus layer ({SML}) of Porites astreoides, a species exhibiting cyclical mucus aging and shedding. Shifts in the prokaryotic community composition during mucus aging led to the prevalence of opportunistic and potentially pathogenic bacteria (Verrucomicrobiaceae and Vibrionaceae) in aged mucus and to a twofold increase in prokaryotic abundance. After the release of aged mucus sheets, the community reverted to its original state, dominated by Endozoicimonaceae and Oxalobacteraceae. Furthermore, we followed the fate of the coral holobiont upon depletion of its natural mucus microbiome through antibiotics treatment. After re-introduction to the reef, healthy-looking microbe-depleted corals started exhibiting clear signs of bleaching and necrosis. Recovery versus mortality of the P. astreoides holobiont was related to the degree of change in abundance distribution of the mucus microbiome. We conclude that the natural prokaryotic community inhabiting the coral {SML} contributes to coral health and that cyclical mucus shedding has a key role in coral microbiome dynamics.},

	abstract = {Temperature's pervasive effects on physiological systems are reflected in the suite of temperature-adaptive differences observed among species from different thermal niches, such as species with different vertical distributions (zonations) along the subtidal to intertidal gradient. Among the physiological traits that exhibit adaptive variation related to vertical zonation are whole organism thermal tolerance, heart function, mitochondrial respiration, membrane static order (fluidity), action potential generation, protein synthesis, heat-shock protein expression, and protein thermal stability. For some, but not all, of these thermally sensitive traits acclimatization leads to adaptive shifts in thermal optima and limits. The costs associated with repairing thermal damage and adapting systems through acclimatization may contribute importantly to energy budgets. These costs arise from such sources as: (i) activation and operation of the heat-shock response, (ii) replacement of denatured proteins that have been removed through proteolysis, (iii) restructuring of cellular membranes (“homeoviscous” adaptation), and (iv) pervasive shifts in gene expression (as gauged by using {DNA} microarray techniques). The vertical zonation observed in rocky intertidal habitats thus may reflect two distinct yet closely related aspects of thermal physiology: (i) intrinsic interspecific differences in temperature sensitivities of physiological systems, which establish thermal optima and tolerance limits for species; and (ii) ‘cost of living’ considerations arising from sub-lethal perturbation of these physiological systems, which may establish an energetics-based limitation to the maximal height at which a species can occur. Quantifying the energetic costs arising from heat stress represents an important challenge for future investigations.},

Four hypotheses were generated and tested using a review of the literature to determine whether they could be supported across taxonomically diverse invasive organisms. The four hypotheses are as follows: (i) broad geographical temperature tolerances (thermal width) confer a higher upper thermal tolerance threshold for invasive rather than native species; (ii) the upper thermal extreme experienced in nature is more highly correlated with upper thermal tolerance threshold for invasive vs. native animals; (iii) protein chaperone expression—a cellular mechanism that underlies an organism's thermal tolerance threshold—is greater in invasive organisms than in native ones; and (iv) acclimation to higher temperatures can promote a greater range of thermal tolerance for invasive compared with native species. Each hypothesis was supported by a meta-analysis of the invasive/thermal physiology literature, providing further evidence that physiology plays a substantial role in the establishment of invasive ectotherms.},

Unfortunately, integrative approaches to identify and describe general patterns and likely drivers of their invasion process have only been of recent interest. The goal of this systematic review is to summarize and categorize the literature published on non-native populations of sea anemone species and to assess whether these records exhibit a shared common invasion pattern. A total of 126 articles were analyzed, in which 11 species presented records of suspected non-native populations. Our results showed that sea anemone invasions date back to at least the late 1890s and new introductions have recently been reported for different species in the last five years. Some potential biases in the literature were found in relation to species, marine realms and study approaches. Most study efforts have been focused on a single species (Diadumene lineata), especially in the Temperate Northern Atlantic. A seemingly common shared pattern was found and described throughout all stages of the invasion continuum, but more effort should be focused on the less reported/studied species. Transport has mainly been mediated by human-associated vectors, such as maritime traffic and aquaculture. Newly arrived individuals colonize mostly natural habitats, although some species thrive in human-made habitats. A diverse array of traits has been associated with the invasion success of sea anemones, although the two most frequently reported traits in the literature were abiotic tolerance and the reproductive strategies. Unlike other benthic invaders, the dispersal mechanisms (both primary and secondary spread) and the ecological or economic consequences produced by nonnative sea anemone populations have been little explored and thus need more attention. We discuss potential ways to reduce some of the gaps and research biases found and thus develop a better understanding of the invasion ecology of sea anemones.},

However, this antagonistic view creates complications for our understanding of beneficial host-microbe interactions. Pathogenic microbes are described as employing a few common behaviors that promote their fitness at the expense of host health and fitness. Here, a complementary framework is proposed to suggest that, in addition to pathogens, beneficial microbes have evolved behaviors to manipulate host processes in order to promote their own fitness and do so through the promotion of host health and fitness. In this Perspective, I explore the idea that patterns or behaviors traditionally ascribed to pathogenic microbes are also employed by beneficial microbes to promote host tolerance defense strategies. Such strategies would promote host health without having a negative impact on microbial fitness and would thereby yield cooperative evolutionary dynamics that are likely required to drive mutualistic co-evolution of hosts and microbes.},

We show that mice infected with epidemic C. difficile (genotype 027/{BI}) develop highly contagious, chronic intestinal disease and persistent dysbiosis characterized by a distinct, simplified microbiota containing opportunistic pathogens and altered metabolite production. Chronic C. difficile 027/{BI} infection was refractory to vancomycin treatment leading to relapsing disease. In contrast, treatment of C. difficile 027/{BI} infected mice with feces from healthy mice rapidly restored a diverse, healthy microbiota and resolved C. difficile disease and contagiousness. We used this model to identify a simple mixture of six phylogenetically diverse intestinal bacteria, including novel species, which can re-establish a health-associated microbiota and clear C. difficile 027/{BI} infection from mice. Thus, targeting a dysbiotic microbiota with a defined mixture of phylogenetically diverse bacteria can trigger major shifts in the microbial community structure that displaces C. difficile and, as a result, resolves disease and contagiousness. Further, we demonstrate a rational approach to harness the therapeutic potential of health-associated microbial communities to treat C. difficile disease and potentially other forms of intestinal dysbiosis.},

Here, we present the first attempts to extrapolate the widespread and well-established use of bacterial consortia to protect or improve health in other organisms (e.g., humans and plants) to corals. Manipulation of the coral-associated microbiome was facilitated through addition of a consortium of native (isolated from Pocillopora damicornis and surrounding seawater) putatively beneficial microorganisms for corals ({pBMCs}), including five Pseudoalteromonas sp., a Halomonas taeanensis and a Cobetia marina-related species strains. The results from a controlled aquarium experiment in two temperature regimes (26 °C and 30 °C) and four treatments ({pBMC}; {pBMC} with pathogen challenge – Vibrio coralliilyticus, {VC}; pathogen challenge, {VC}; and control) revealed the ability of the {pBMC} consortium to partially mitigate coral bleaching. Significantly reduced coral-bleaching metrics were observed in {pBMC}-inoculated corals, in contrast to controls without {pBMC} addition, especially challenged corals, which displayed strong bleaching signs as indicated by significantly lower photopigment contents and Fv/Fm ratios. The structure of the coral microbiome community also differed between treatments and specific bioindicators were correlated with corals inoculated with {pBMC} (e.g., Cobetia sp.) or {VC} (e.g., Ruegeria sp.). Our results indicate that the microbiome in corals can be manipulated to lessen the effect of bleaching, thus helping to alleviate pathogen and temperature stresses, with the addition of {BMCs} representing a promising novel approach for minimizing coral mortality in the face of increasing environmental impacts.},

Here, chemosynthetic bacteria living in close association with their hosts convert {CO}2 or {CH}4 into organic compounds and provide the host with necessary nutrients. The dominant macrofauna of hydrothermal vent and cold seep ecosystems all depend on the metabolic activity of chemosynthetic bacteria, which accounts for almost all primary production in these complex ecosystems. Many of these enigmatic mutualistic associations are found within the molluscan class Bivalvia. Currently, chemosynthetic symbioses have been reported from five distinct bivalve families (Lucinidae, Mytilidae, Solemyidae, Thyasiridae, and Vesicomyidae).

	abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity is an important strategy that animals employ to respond and adjust to changes in their environment. Plasticity may occur via changes in host gene expression or through functional changes in their microbiomes, which contribute substantially to host physiology. Specifically, the presence and function of host-associated microbes can impact how animals respond to heat stress. We previously demonstrated that ‘depleted’ tadpoles, with artificially disrupted microbiomes, are less tolerant to heat than ‘colonized’ tadpoles, with more natural microbiomes. However, the mechanisms behind these effects are unclear. Here, we compared gene expression profiles of the tadpole gut transcriptome, and tadpole gut microbial metagenome, between colonized and depleted tadpoles under cool or warm conditions. Our goal was to identify differences in host and microbial responses to heat between colonized and depleted tadpoles that might explain their observed differences in heat tolerance. We found that depleted tadpoles exhibited a much stronger degree of host gene expression plasticity in response to heat, while the microbiome of colonized tadpoles was significantly more heat sensitive. These patterns indicate that functional changes in the microbiome in response to heat may allow for a dampened host response, ultimately buffering hosts from the deleterious effects of heat stress. We also identified several specific host and microbial pathways that could be contributing to increased thermal tolerance in colonized tadpoles including amino acid metabolism, vitamin biosynthesis and {ROS} scavenging pathways. Our results demonstrate that the microbiome influences host plasticity and the response of hosts to environmental stressors.},

However, many coral species have adapted to high temperature environments such as the Red Sea ({RS}). To investigate mechanisms underlying temperature adaptation in zooxanthellate cnidarians we compared transcriptome- and proteome-wide heat stress response (24 h at 32°C) of three strains of the model organism
              Aiptasia pallida
              from regions with differing temperature profiles; North Carolina ({CC}7), Hawaii (H2) and the {RS}. Correlations between transcript and protein levels were generally low but inter-strain comparisons highlighted a common core cnidarian response to heat stress, including protein folding and oxidative stress pathways. {RS} anemones showed the strongest increase in antioxidant gene expression and exhibited significantly lower reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) levels
              in hospite
              . However, comparisons of antioxidant gene and protein expression between strains did not show strong differences, indicating similar antioxidant capacity across the strains. Subsequent analysis of {ROS} production in isolated symbionts confirmed that the observed differences of {ROS} levels
              in hospite
              were symbiont-driven. Our findings indicate that {RS} anemones do not show increased antioxidant capacity but may have adapted to higher temperatures through association with more thermally tolerant symbionts.},

	abstract = {At the current rate of climate change, it is unlikely that multicellular organisms will be able to adapt to changing environmental conditions through genetic recombination and natural selection alone. Thus, it is critical to understand alternative mechanisms that allow organisms to cope with rapid environmental changes. Here, we use the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, which has evolved the capability of surviving in a wide range of temperatures and salinities, as a model to investigate the microbiota as a source of rapid adaptation. We long-term acclimate polyps of Nematostella to low, medium, and high temperatures, to test the impact of microbiota-mediated plasticity on animal acclimation. Using the same animal clonal line, propagated from a single polyp, allows us to eliminate the effects of the host genotype. The higher thermal tolerance of animals acclimated to high temperature can be transferred to non-acclimated animals through microbiota transplantation. The offspring fitness is highest from F0 females acclimated to high temperature and specific members of the acclimated microbiota are transmitted to the next generation. These results indicate that microbiota plasticity can contribute to animal thermal acclimation and its transmission to the next generation may represent a rapid mechanism for thermal adaptation.},

Work in model organisms, human biopsies, and cell culture demonstrate that the gut microbiome is an important regulator of several host pathways relevant for disease, including immune development and energy metabolism, and vice versa. The gut microbiome remodels host chromatin, causes differential splicing, alters the epigenetic landscape, and directly interrupts host signaling cascades. Emerging techniques like single-cell {RNA} sequencing and organoid generation have the potential to refine our understanding of the relationship between the gut microbiome and host gene expression in the future. By intersecting microbiome and host gene expression, we gain a window into the physiological processes important for fostering the extensive cross-kingdom interactions and ultimately our health.},

The sea anemone, Exaiptasia diaphana, is a popular coral model, but the response of its bacteria to thermal stress has been barely explored. To address this, we compared the bacterial communities of Great Barrier Reef ({GBR}) E. diaphana maintained at 26 \&deg;C or exposed to increasing temperature (26\&ndash;33 \&deg;C) over two weeks. Communities were analyzed by metabarcoding of the bacterial 16S {rRNA} gene. Bleaching and Symbiodiniaceae health were assessed by Symbiodiniaceae cell density and dark-adapted quantum yield (Fv/Fm), respectively. Significant bleaching and reductions in Fv/Fm occurred in the heat-treated anemones above 29 \&deg;C. Overall declines in bacterial alpha diversity in all anemones were also observed. Signs of bacterial change emerged above 31 \&deg;C. Some initial outcomes may have been influenced by relocation or starvation, but collectively, the bacterial community and taxa-level data suggested that heat was the primary driver of change above 32 \&deg;C. Six bacterial indicator species were identified as potential biomarkers for thermal stress. We conclude that the bacterial microbiome of {GBR} E. diaphana is generally stable until a thermal threshold is surpassed, after which significant changes occur.},

However, established E. diaphana clonal lines are not available in Australia thus limiting the ability of Australian scientists to conduct research with this model. To help address this, the bacterial and Symbiodiniaceae associates of four Great Barrier Reef ({GBR})-sourced E. diaphana genotypes established in laboratory aquaria and designated {AIMS}1–4, and from proxies of wild {GBR} E. diaphana were identified by metabarcoding of the bacterial 16S {rRNA} gene and eukaryotic {rRNA} gene {ITS}2 region.

However, increasing {pCO}2 may alter the bacterial community of marine organisms, significantly affecting the health status of the host. A {pH} gradient associated with a natural volcanic vent system within Levante Bay, Vulcano Island, Italy, was used to test the effects of ocean acidification on the bacterial community of two anemone species in situ, Anemonia viridis and Actinia equina using 16 S {rDNA} pyrosequencing. Results showed the bacterial community of the two anemone species differed significantly from each other primarily because of differences in the Gammaproteobacteria and Epsilonproteobacteria abundances. The bacterial communities did not differ within species among sites with decreasing {pH} except for A. viridis at the vent site ({pH} = 6.05). In addition to low {pH}, the vent site contains trace metals and sulfide that may have influenced the bacteria community of A. viridis. The stability of the bacterial community from {pH} 8.1 to {pH} 7.4, coupled with previous experiments showing the lack of, or beneficial changes within anemones living under low {pH} conditions indicates that A. viridis and A. equina will be winners under future ocean acidification scenarios.},

	abstract = {All animals studied to date are associated with symbiotic communities of microorganisms. These animal microbiotas often play important roles in normal physiological function and susceptibility to disease; predicting their responses to perturbation represents an essential challenge for microbiology. Most studies of microbiome dynamics test for patterns in which perturbation shifts animal microbiomes from a healthy to a dysbiotic stable state. Here, we consider a complementary alternative: that the microbiological changes induced by many perturbations are stochastic, and therefore lead to transitions from stable to unstable community states. The result is an ‘Anna Karenina principle’ for animal microbiomes, in which dysbiotic individuals vary more in microbial community composition than healthy individuals—paralleling Leo Tolstoy's dictum that “all happy families look alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way”. We argue that Anna Karenina effects are a common and important response of animal microbiomes to stressors that reduce the ability of the host or its microbiome to regulate community composition. Patterns consistent with Anna Karenina effects have been found in systems ranging from the surface of threatened corals exposed to above-average temperatures, to the lungs of patients suffering from {HIV}/{AIDs}. However, despite their apparent ubiquity, these patterns are easily missed or discarded by some common workflows, and therefore probably underreported. Now that a substantial body of research has established the existence of these patterns in diverse systems, rigorous testing, intensive time-series datasets and improved stochastic modelling will help to explore their importance for topics ranging from personalized medicine to theories of the evolution of host–microorganism symbioses.},
