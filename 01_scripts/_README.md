#Project Description: 
This is a project repository for the Anemone Temperature Stress Experiment data collected at Cal Poly Humboldt in 2022-2023. Diadumene lineata underwent temperature stress trials from 20C-30C (in 2.5 degree increments) to monitor changes in their bacterial community. The data is a follow-up experiment from 2021 with three species of anemone from 0C-40C in 10 degree increments.

This folder contains all scripts associated with the project.
